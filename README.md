# Object Detection Experimental Training Project

## Description
The R&D department is exploring possibilities for conducting experimental training for an object detection model and has reached out to evaluate whether the dataset, prepared by the image annotation team, is sufficient to initiate training. This project focuses on analyzing the dataset available [here](https://universe.roboflow.com/personal-protective-equipment/ppes-kaxsi/dataset/4) to determine its suitability and accuracy for model training.
